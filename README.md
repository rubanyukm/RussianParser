# RussianParser

A parser written using PyScript that uses an automata to determine whether a Russian sentence is valid gramatically or not.
The project can downloaded and then run using the **live server** extension for VSCode. Simply enter in a sentence from the provided
vocabulary and the parser will determine if it is valid or not.
